# open-data

Open data sets, tools, and discussion hosted by IBM Cloud Data Services (CDS).

While [Analytics Exchange](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/data/exchange/) is the primary site for finding and using open data sets with IBM's cloud databases, here you can find processing tools, sample apps and scripts, and smaller, *ad-hoc* test data sets.

Each directory has it's own specific README.md file describing its contents and purpose.


## Terms of Use

IBM does not warranty the completeness, accuracy, content, or fitness for any particular purpose or use of any public data set made available in this repository, nor are any such warranties to be implied or inferred with respect to the public data sets furnished therein.

Files in this repository are hosted here as a convenience to the open data community. IBM puts no restrictions or terms of use beyond what is present in each data set's original license. All users should read the README.md and LICENSE files in each directory to find our best available information regarding the terms of use of each data set in that directory.
