US Census data from the 2013 American Community Survey aggregated to the
zip code level.

#### About the ACS

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides
vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people.
Information from the survey generates data that help determine how more
than \$400 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year.

Through the ACS, we know more about jobs and occupations, educational
attainment, veterans, whether people own or rent their home, and other
topics. Public officials, planners, and entrepreneurs use this
information to assess the past and plan the future.

#### Files
